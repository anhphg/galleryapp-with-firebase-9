To use this, first create a webapp on Firebase to get your own API key and other details. after you get the clone of this app, unzip and:
$ cd galleryapp-with-firebase-9
$ npm install (or run yarn install if you are using yarn)
Fill in the firebase.js file with your own Firebase API setup.
$npm start
